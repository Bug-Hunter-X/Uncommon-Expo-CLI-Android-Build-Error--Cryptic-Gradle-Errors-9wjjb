# Uncommon Expo CLI Android Build Error: Cryptic Gradle Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI. The error manifests as cryptic messages from the Gradle build system, making diagnosis difficult.  This example showcases the problem and its solution.

## Problem
The Expo CLI Android build process fails with unclear Gradle errors.  The exact error message can vary, but it usually indicates problems during dependency resolution, compilation, or linking.

## Solution
The solution often involves carefully reviewing the project's dependencies and ensuring they are compatible.  This includes verifying the versions of your dependencies in `package.json` and ensuring that no conflicts exist.  Additional configurations may need to be adjusted within the `android` directory of the Expo project.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to build the Android app using the command `expo prebuild` or `expo build:android`.
4. Observe the Gradle errors.

## How to Fix
1. Check for incompatible dependencies in `package.json` by comparing with the last known working state of your project if applicable.
2. Review the `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/build.gradle` files for any misconfigurations.
3. Clean and rebuild the project using the commands `expo prebuild --clean` and `expo build:android --clean`. 
4. If the issue persists, examine the full Gradle error log for more specific clues regarding dependency or configuration problems. 
5. Consider creating a minimal reproducible example to help isolate the problematic dependency or setting.
6. Upgrade Expo and related packages.  There might be issues caused by older versions.
