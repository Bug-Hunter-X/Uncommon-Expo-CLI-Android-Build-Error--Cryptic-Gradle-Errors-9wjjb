// bugSolution.js
// This file demonstrates solutions to the Gradle build errors.
//  The solution would likely involve the following steps (shown conceptually): 
// 1.  Dependency Version Checks and Updates:
//     - Check package.json for incompatible dependencies and update them to compatible versions. 
//     -  If conflicts exist, resolve them by using version ranges or specific versions that work together.
// 2. Android Gradle Configuration Fixes:
//    - Ensure that build.gradle files are properly configured, with correct dependencies and plugin versions. 
//    - Verify the settings.gradle file, to avoid problems during the expo prebuild stage 
// 3. Clean Build:
//     - Use expo prebuild --clean or expo build:android --clean before rebuilding to clear any cached build artifacts.  
// Example (Illustrative, actual solution depends on the specific error):
const dependencies = {
  "react-native-maps": "^1.3.2", //Example update to resolve a compatibility issue
  "expo-location": "^15.0.0"// Example update to resolve a compatibility issue
};

// In the project's package.json, update your dependencies to match
// this example solution.

// Then run the expo prebuild  --clean or expo build:android --clean 
// to ensure you resolved the underlying issue.
