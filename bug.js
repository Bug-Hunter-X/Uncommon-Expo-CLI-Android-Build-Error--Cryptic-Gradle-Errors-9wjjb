This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `gradle` build system.  The specific error message can vary, but it usually points to issues during the compilation or linking process.  One common root cause is an incompatibility or conflict between different versions of dependencies in your project's `build.gradle` files or your project's package.json and the expo managed workflow.  Another cause is missing or incorrect configurations within the `android` directory of your project.  Sometimes the gradle sync may just fail to finish and Expo may not provide enough details to fix it.
